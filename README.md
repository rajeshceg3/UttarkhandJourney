# Uttarakhand Interactive Travel Map

This project is an interactive travel map of Uttarakhand, a state in northern India known for its Hindu pilgrimage sites. The map allows users to explore various locations, filter them by type, and create their own travel itinerary.

## Features

*   **Interactive Map:** The map is built with Leaflet and displays various locations in Uttarakhand, including cities, hill stations, pilgrimage sites, and parks.
*   **Location Filtering:** Users can filter locations by type (e.g., "pilgrimage," "hill station") to easily find what they're looking for.
*   **Custom Itinerary:** Users can add locations to their trip plan and see them listed in the sidebar. The itinerary is saved in the browser's local storage, so it persists across sessions.
*   **Location Details:** Clicking on a location in the sidebar or on the map opens a popup with more information about the location, including a description and an image.
*   **Dark Mode:** The application features a dark mode for a better user experience in low-light environments.
*   **Responsive Design:** The layout is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
